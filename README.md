# What the application does. 
>When the application launches it opens in a iOS MapKit map. On the map if your interested in a specific area, long press and the map will have a red pin annotation. Pressing that annotation like a button will navigate you to another screen split with a map on about  one third of the screen and a collection view on the other two thirds. The map will have your long press annotation on it in the upper one third of the screen. The collection view pulls down new images from Flickr associated with the annotated location. After several seconds the photos will persist along with the pin data. Once the data persist, pressing the pin will not cause the application to download again for that particular pin, it will just retrieve from core data.  It will only download again at that particular pin if you pull to refresh the collection view. For other places of interest just long press.
